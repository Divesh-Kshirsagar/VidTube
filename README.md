👋 Hello there! I'm excited to share VidTube, a practice project inspired by the functionality of YouTube, built with industry-standard coding practices in mind. It's a platform where you can share videos 📹, upload thumbnails🖼️, create playlists <0xF0><0x9F><0x8E><0x9E>, and even post short text updates similar to tweets 🐦!

## 🛠️ Built With:

* **Backend:** Node.js 
* **Framework:** Express.js 🌐
* **Database:** MongoDB 🍃
* **Cloud Media Storage:** Cloudinary ☁️
* **User Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 🔑

## ✨ Features:

* **Video Uploads:** Seamlessly upload your video content to share with others. ⬆️
* **Video Streaming:** Efficiently stream videos in packets using ffmpeg for optimized playback. 🎞️
* **Thumbnail Support:** Upload custom thumbnails to make your videos stand out. 🖼️
* **Tweet-like Posts:** Share short text updates, thoughts, or announcements. 🐦
* **Playlist Creation:** Organize your favorite videos into curated playlists. 
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login powered by JWT. 🔒
* **Industry Standard Code:** Developed with best practices for code structure, maintainability, and scalability. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

## 🚀 Getting Started:

To run VidTube on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd vidtube
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    * Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

        ```env
        PORT=YOUR_PREFERRED_PORT (e.g., 5000)
        MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the server, and you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:YOUR_PREFERRED_PORT`.
